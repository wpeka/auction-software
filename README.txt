== How to get started with WPAuction software ==

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hREy6K8PsOU]

It is effortless to set up WPAuction software in different auction modes. You can use these auctions to create professional auction websites, eBay-type auctions, and many more. The plugin comes with pre-designed email templates that make it easy for you to customize the email notifications. The plugin works with all modern WordPress themes available.

= The various types of WooCommerce Auctions supported by this plugin are: =

👶**Forward Auction**: It’s the most common type of auction. Auction starts from a specific price, and users bid for the product. If the reserve price is met at the end of the auction, the user with the highest bid can buy the product.

👦**Reverse Auction**: This auction is the reverse of a Forward auction. The auction will start from a specific price, and users place bids to lower the bid price. The user with the lowest bid wins. This auction is suitable for government contracts, service contracts, work to be awarded to lower bidders.

👨**Penny Auction (PRO version)**: In Penny auction, the user needs to buy credits/bids. Once the user places a bid, the amount set (usually a penny) gets deducted. This amount is non-refundable, and the bidder with the highest bid can buy the product. You can also extend the auction each time someone places a new bid. This way, you let your users bid aggressively and sell them products at attractive prices.

This online auction plugin allows you to create a vendor auction marketplace on your website, allowing other users to host their auctions on your site. All they need to do is simply register on your auction website and list their products. You can then specify the percentage of commission for every single vendor.
